<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ME{top 3} </h1>

<h3>1.CAPTAIN SULLY</h3>
<p>one of the most amazing movie i have ever seen its about a tragic incident that could have taken so many lives but it was all captain's grace that saved alot of lives because they made an emergency landing into the water and no one got injured , the plane was actually a fell victim of bird strike that happened in the mid air</p>
<h3>2.THE RUNWAY 37</h3>
<p>The most bizzare incident , it is a real story of jet airways which was landing at trivandrum airport but due to worst weather conditions they had to go around the aircraft about 17 times and at  last they were running short of fuel which could have lead to crash and that aircraft contained around 265 passengers but at last all landed safely</P>
<h3>3.EMEREGENCY DECLARATION</h3>
<P>it is a south koream film which is about a strange terrorist incident which was not about high jack or something but in that film one strange man sprayed something in the aircraft and that lead to deaths onboard if inhaled, must watch film if you love thrillers</P>
